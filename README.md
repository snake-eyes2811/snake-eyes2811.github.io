#About Me
##My Interests
My hobbies include singing and playing guitar as well as boxing and jiu jitsu
##Cool Websites I recommend
https://monkeytype.com/ Monkey Type is a minimalistic typing test. I find it intersting because in my opinion it is the most aesthetically pleasing typing website out there.
https://www.komoot.com/ Komoot is a website that helps find hiking and biking trails. I find it interesting because I love hiking and this really helps to plan routes in areas I am unfamiliar with.
